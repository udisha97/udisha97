Hi! I am Udisha,

I am passionate about deriving insights from data and presenting it .

I have worked in Yes Bank as a data analyst in the past and I am currently pursuing Business Analytics from IIM Indore, with my experience I have come to understand that data science is an ever evolving field, 

My strength lies in keeping up with this rapid growth through continuous learning; I try to be  the first one to pick up and  implement a new technology . 

Coding me not be my forte yet but I am a Problem Solver if you give me a problem statement you can remain confident that I
will give you a solution even if I have to learn
 a completely new technology.
